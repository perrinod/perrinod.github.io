        <center><h2>About Me</h2></center>

<hr />
<p>Hello, my name is Domenick Perrino.  I am a graduate of University of Nevada Las Vegas in Computer Science. In the next few years I would like to continue my education and obtain a Masters degree in computer science.  Currently I’m working on a video game to be released on PC and possibly a future release of it on ios and android.</p>
