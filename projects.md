<center><h4>Created Using:</h4></center>

*   C++

This checkers program was designed to play against a human opponent after machine learning the game of checkers.  Using the algorithms least mean square, alpha beta pruning, linear heuristics, and mini-max.

The checkers program begins by playing itself n amount of time.  Refining the evaluation of what it gives to a given checkers board state and machine learning the game of checkers.  After n games have been played the program will use what it has learned to play against a human opponent.

This is part of the output of the checkers ai program.  The images represent a single move as the computer plays against itself.  The image on the left represents the current board state.  The image on the right shows the move the computer made and a score representing the evaluation of the board state after the move.  A positive or negative evaluation represents if either white or black has a better position.
